# dinsol-v1.0
The Daily INSOLationi (DINSOL-v1.0) is a model that simulates the incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere following the Milankovitch cycles. The program is ideal for preparing the boundary conditions of climate models, beyond to be a helpful tool for educational purposes. The program allows the user to design the solar radiation data using many options, such as setting the number of points of latitude and longitude, the solar constant, a calendar of 365 or 360 days, or choosing between the most famous parameterizations to the Earth orbital parameters (EOP): Be78, Be90, and Laskar. The users can also set the EOP freely, which allows simulating the solar radiation of hypothetical cases, such as exoplanets. Moreover, by adopting the graphical user interface (GUI), the users can run the tool intuitively and generate many windows containing each simulation. By the way, in order to assist the users in accessing each data, the program still has some R scripts. Therefore, the DINSOL can be a good option for students, teachers, and researchers that needs to perform some study (e.g., climate simulation, photosynthesis, etc.) or wish to teach about insolation during paleoclimatology classes.
