 Hello,

 In this folder, there are two scripts: "gui_plot.R" and "replace.sh". 
 The "gui_plot.R" is a custom script that makes graphs for GUI mode, 
 but the GUI mode requires ready data for comparison with current days,
 and the "replace.sh" build all this data. The "replace.sh" script 
 was created for the users to update easily the data adopted in "gui_plot.R",
 because if you wish to exchange your compiler, for example, then you'll 
 need to update the current data with the "replace.sh". Note, the 
 "replace.sh" make all data for a solar constant of 1366 W/m^2. Then,
 if you intend to change this value, you should edit the "replace.sh"
 file.

 Best regards,

 Emerson D. Oliveira
